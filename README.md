##HDInsight Tools

Currently this is just a module containing some helpers that make life with HDInsight easier.

##Why?

Because actions like uploading and downloading files are things you do every day, so it makes sense to encapsulate them in a nice function, rather than writing 5+ lines of code everytime you write a new script to upload something, run a job, and download the results.

##Installing

1. Download the `hdinsight-tools.psm1`.

2. From PowerShell, use `import-module hdinsight-tools.psm1` to load the module.

##Using

You must have an active Azure subscription to use this. You must also have an active subscription associated with the Azure PowerShell (Add-AzureAccount or Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile). The HDInsight-Tools will bark at you if you don't have these.

###Working with files

* __Add-HDInsightFile__ - Adds a single file from the local file system (or networked,) to the primary storage container for your HDInsight cluster

* __Remove-HDInsightFile__ - Removes a single file from the primary storage container for your HDInsight cluster

* __Get-HDInsightFile__ - Gets a single file from the primary storage container for your HDInsight cluster

* __Find-HDInsightFile__ - Lists file(s) from the primary storage container for your HDInsight cluster

* __Get-HDInsightStorage__ - Lists the storage account(s) associated with your HDInsight cluster. Mostly useful if you are going to use some other tool like [AzCopy](http://aka.ms/azcopy)


__NOTE__: This currently only works on one file at a time. Mainly because it depends on using a context generated by New-AzureStorageContext, and this doesn't serialize/deserialize when using workflows, which you have to use with foreach -parallel. If you have a solution to this to allow parallel file operations using a file context, please let me know. Otherwise, use Get-HDInsightStorage to find your storage containers, then use something like AzCopy to perform bulk copy operations.
